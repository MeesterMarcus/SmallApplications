azimuth problem

Two points between two cities and the north pole will be the triangle
Need two angles to compute third angle
Have to find angle in which the plane should travel to the other city

special cases:
when a triangle isn't formed, if they are directly north and south of each other.
the other hemisphere


graphs

a graph is a more general data struct than a tree and usually has a more complex implementation 
unlike a tree a graph may have loops
graphs tend to represent data relationships more complex than ehirarchy and/or ordering
a typical use it hat of a map 

simple graph: no loops or multi-edges

cyclic graph contains no cycles

Two Common Dats Structures:
-Adjacency Matrix (simpler)
-Adjacency List 

Shortest Paths:
-Dijkstra's algorithm 


Implementation
-EAch city needs to store the edges and destinations out of it
-it simplifies matters to give te nodes a short name that can be mapped either way tothe long name of the city
-you will need an auxillary array to store the parent of each node from s
-can be done without a priority queue by doing a brute force min search
